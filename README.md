# SpotiGotchi

An open-source Spotify display device inspired by Tamagotchi, showing live album artwork, track details, and playback status on an LED matrix.

## Overview

SpotiGotchi is a hardware-software project that brings Spotify playback to a compact LED matrix display. The goal is to combine playful, pet-like visuals with the practical glanceability of a now-playing screen, so you can see what’s on without opening an app.

## Features

- Live album artwork and track details in a pixel-art friendly layout.
- Playback status indicators (play/pause, progress, and device state).
- Designed for small LED matrix hardware with low-power, always-on display use cases.

## Getting Started

This repository currently focuses on defining the project scope and documentation. Implementation details, build steps, and hardware requirements will be added as the software and firmware mature.

If you want to help shape the early roadmap, open an issue or discussion with ideas for:

- Supported LED matrix hardware.
- Spotify authentication and playback control approaches.
- UI layouts optimized for tiny displays.

## Project Status

Early exploration and planning. Expect rapid iteration and breaking changes as the foundation is established.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss proposals before starting significant work. This helps coordinate direction and avoid duplicated effort.

## License

License information will be added as the project formalizes.
